I used Google analytics and analytics on various social media platforms to track the effectiveness of different communication approaches, refining messaging based on what resonated most with potential donors. I applied behavioral science principles, such as the endowment effect and crowd-out effect, to optimize social media posts.\nI crafted engaging content for Facebook, Instagram, and the website, including client stories, achievements, donor spotlights, facts and figures, service updates, news, events, and sponsor promotions. I created a content calendar with targeted calls to action for the primary demographics and presented the strategy to the Fundraising team and Board of Directors. I also coordinated partnerships with sponsors and partners to amplify our reach through cross-promotion."

This involved creating a brand guide and design system that was story-driven, youth-led, and action-oriented. To evaluate the impact of social media campaigns, I designed a logic model and integrated tools like Google Analytics, heatmaps, and eye-tracking software to monitor user engagement and encourage care-seeking behaviors.\nTo better understand and engage YGetIt?‚Äôs audience, I scraped over 600 comments from the Tested comic on Webtoons using Python, Pandas, and Selenium. I conducted thematic and exploratory data analysis to identify trends in public sentiment and inform the creation of culturally responsive content for future episodes. This data-driven approach guided the visual design and content strategy for the website. I performed usability testing through various design fidelities that led to a centralized platform where readers could easily subscribe to edutainment episodes, access actionable HIV resources, and engage with each other.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nView code on Github"

This included revising dropdown menus for gender preferences, updating insurance status fields, and improving microcopy, tooltips, emails, and instructional content. Our content strategy prioritized language justice, clarity, transparency, and trust to minimize decision fatigue, reduce information overload, and correct misaligned mental models.\nTo ensure the portal was more user-friendly, we conducted two rounds of moderated and unmoderated remote usability testing on high-fidelity prototypes, closely collaborating with the governor‚Äôs office and department staff to refine the design based on user feedback."

    "text": "City, county, and state governments were inundated with thousands of complaints from residents who were confused about their eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine, how to access vaccination clinics, and where to sign up. Public servants were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of support tickets and calls from residents struggling to navigate the available resources. The lack of clear, accessible information not only created frustration among the public but also highlighted significant digital equity gaps that needed to be addressed for more effective communication and service delivery.\nTo help solve these challenges, U.S. Digital Response(USDR) partnered with governments, nonprofits, and public entities to respond to critical public needs by rapidly activating highly-skilled talent. As the Research and Design Lead/Technologist-in-Residence for the Health Program at the height of the pandemic, I led efforts to build accessible vaccination portals and websites for local and state governments. Many existing websites failed to meet accessibility standards and conveyed complex health information that hindered communities, especially those harder to reach, from easily booking vaccination appointments. My role focused on creating user-friendly, equitable digital experiences that enabled governments to communicate effectively with all residents and close the digital equity gaps."

    "text": "Approach\nI led over 19 projects in seven months with cities, counties, state governments, health departments, agencies, and community-based organizations to create equitable and accessible website designs and content using health literacy, plain language guidelines, and crisis communication. I managed more than 30 volunteers to deliver evidence-based research, including comparative analysis, contextual inquiry, usability testing, interviewing, and survey analysis, increasing governments‚Äô confidence and connection with their communities. I implemented cognitive biases in writing and communication to influence health and care-seeking behaviors in social media posts and patient education brochures. I developed, edited, and gathered information to create clear, concise, and compelling materials for key stakeholders and audiences, including press releases, speeches, blogs, op-eds, backgrounders, talking points, scripts, reports, stories, and website copy. I built governments‚Äô capacity to integrate literacy and equity into digital media through website templates and a toolkit."
