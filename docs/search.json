    "text": "What is this study about?\nCities, counties, and townships across the United States are investing in parks and green spaces to improve health, advance equity, and strengthen climate resilience. But what helps local governments make that happen—and what gets in the way?\nThis study looks upstream, beyond how parks are built, to the policies, land use decisions, and organizational practices that shape equity.\nLocal governments are central to this work. With control over zoning, funding, and infrastructure, they shape how communities adapt to climate risks and who benefits from those decisions.\nWe’re exploring both sides of the story:\n\n• Internal readiness — how prepared local governments are to act on parks and green space equity\n\n• External pressures — outside forces like funding, mandates, and politics that influence action\nWe’re also analyzing park and green space policies nationwide to see how equity shows up in practice and where gaps remain. By sharing your experience, you’ll help identify the conditions, partnerships, and resources that make equitable green space possible.\nThis research is part of a doctoral dissertation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, led by student researcher Elham Ali, MPH, PMP, under the supervision of Jill Marsteller, PhD, MPP (IRB00034299).\nThe Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board has reviewed this study and determined it is “not human subjects research” under DHHS regulations 45 CFR 46.102. That means we’re asking about your professional perspectives of your organization, not private or personal information. Your responses will stay confidential."

With these data we provide bias-corrected estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and quantify the uncertainty induced by aggregation measurement error. The data demonstrate that official Census Tract definitions overstate the degree of racial segregation in the United States.

I argue that policymakers are more likely to side against partisan interests when the law is more explicit. I apply this to partisan gerrymandering in the United States, where map drawers can manipulate district boundaries to favor one party. This provides a hard test, where partisan interests are directly at odds with democratic principles and the stakes of any decision are high. Using new data on the 2020 redistricting cycle combined with redistricting simulations, I find that map drawers typically follow rules that protect partisan fairness. Further, if a partisan gerrymandering case is brought against a redistricting plan, courts are more likely to rule against a plan when there is an explicit law against partisan gerrymandering. When courts intervene, they consistently, but only moderately, decrease the partisan bias of the plan. I then demonstrate that compliance with other, nonpartisan redistricting rules is highest when it is easiest to measure violations. This contributes optimistic evidence that rules effectively bind partisans."

We conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the Bureau’s two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed for the 2020 Census and the swapping algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown’s post-processing dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and noise. These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population sizes and racial diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no larger than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.\n\n\n\n\n@misc{kenn:etal:24b,\n  author = {Christopher T.

PNAS.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n\n\nCongressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors, raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of gerrymandering from the effects of other factors including geography and redistricting rules, we compare predicted election outcomes under the enacted plan with those under a large sample of non-partisan, simulated alternative plans for all states. We find that partisan gerrymandering is widespread in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it creates cancels at the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on average. In contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting rules remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral competition and makes the House’s partisan composition less responsive to shifts in the national vote.\n\n\n\n\n@article{kenn:etal:23b,\nauthor = {Christopher T.

Harvard Data Science Review.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n\n\nIn “Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau’s Use of Differential Privacy,” boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts. In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth. We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by arguing that policy makers must confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.\n\n\n\n\n@article{kenn:etal:23,\n    author = {Kenny, Christopher T. and Kuriwaki, Shiro and McCartan, Cory and Rosenman, Evan T.

The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial efforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specific redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete workflow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states. The resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We also provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for customized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available. This article details the design, creation, and validation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n@article{50statesSimulations,\n  title = {Simulated Redistricting Plans for the Analysis and Evaluation of Redistricting in the {{United States}}},\n  author = {McCartan, Cory and Kenny, Christopher T. and Simko, Tyler and Garcia, George and Wang, Kevin and Wu, Melissa and Kuriwaki, Shiro and Imai, Kosuke},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = nov,\n  journal = {Scientific Data},\n  volume = {9},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {689},\n  issn = {2052-4463},\n  doi = {10.1038/s41597-022-01808-2},\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe use of differential privacy for census data and its impact on redistricting: The case of the 2020 U.S. Census\n(with Shiro Kuriwaki, Cory McCartan, Evan T.

By applying redistricting simulation and analysis methods to DAS-protected 2010 Census data, we find that the protected data are not of sufficient quality for redistricting purposes. We demonstrate that the injected noise makes it impossible for states to accurately comply with the One Person, One Vote principle. Our analysis finds that the DAS-protected data are biased against certain areas, depending on voter turnout and partisan and racial composition, and that these biases lead to large and unpredictable errors in the analysis of partisan and racial gerrymanders. Finally, we show that the DAS algorithm does not universally protect respondent privacy. Based on the names and addresses of registered voters, we are able to predict their race as accurately using the DAS-protected data as when using the 2010 Census data. Despite this, the DAS-protected data can still inaccurately estimate the number of majority-minority districts.

Statistics and Public Policy.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nBibTeX\n\n\n\n\nAs granular data about elections and voters become available, redistricting simulation methods are playing an increasingly important role when legislatures adopt redistricting plans and courts determine their legality. These simulation methods are designed to yield a representative sample of all redistricting plans that satisfy statutory guidelines and requirements such as contiguity, population parity, and compactness. A proposed redistricting plan can be considered gerrymandered if it constitutes an outlier relative to this sample according to partisan fairness metrics. Despite their growing use, an insufficient effort has been made to empirically validate the accuracy of the simulation methods. We apply a recently developed computational method that can efficiently enumerate all possible redistricting plans and yield an independent sample from this population. We show that this algorithm scales to a state with a couple of hundred geographical units. Finally, we empirically examine how existing simulation methods perform on realistic validation datasets.\n\n\n\n\n@article{fife:etal:20,\n  author = {Benjamin Fifield and Kosuke Imai and Jun Kawahara and Christopher T.

I used Google analytics and analytics on various social media platforms to track the effectiveness of different communication approaches, refining messaging based on what resonated most with potential donors. I applied behavioral science principles, such as the endowment effect and crowd-out effect, to optimize social media posts.\nI crafted engaging content for Facebook, Instagram, and the website, including client stories, achievements, donor spotlights, facts and figures, service updates, news, events, and sponsor promotions. I created a content calendar with targeted calls to action for the primary demographics and presented the strategy to the Fundraising team and Board of Directors. I also coordinated partnerships with sponsors and partners to amplify our reach through cross-promotion."

    "text": "At the height of the pandemic, I worked with local and state public health departments to design COVID-19 vaccination and testing products at the speed of need. Colleagues felt traumatized, disconnected, and burnt out (PH WINS data validates this too). (Beaumont 2021) It was like watching your friends go through an out-of-body experience because of this shared, collective trauma.\nSo when I first saw the term antifragility (coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb) in an article by Dr. Marissa J. Levine, I was intrigued. (Taleb 2014; Mulloy 2023) Not because humans can thrive amidst adversity but because the conditions organizations foster for their staff to prosper at work matter even more.\nAntifragility is about having more chaos and stress in our daily lives to test our institutions. While resilience is about bouncing back from adversity (like recovering from an injury), antifragility is about getting stronger and thriving in the face of challenges. For example, when you exercise, your muscles experience stress and strain, causing tiny tears in the fibers. However, when you rest and recover, your body repairs the damage and becomes stronger than before.\nTo be antifragile, organizations need to do some prereqs:\n\n1️⃣ Culture of experimentation to embrace uncertainty\nAntifragility requires a willingness to experiment and learn. Employees need to feel safe to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas without fear of losing their jobs or being reprimanded. Create a culture that celebrates continuous iterations of work-in-progress deliverables and recognizes that failure is necessary for learning.\n\n\n2️⃣ Resilience and adaptability\nBuild cross-functional teams that can quickly adapt to changing circumstances with role charters. Encourage employees to be flexible and open-minded by applying principles from human-centered design, and provide coaching to support ongoing learning and development.\n\n\n3️⃣ Redundancy and decentralization\nDevelop and train leaders and managers to value decentralization and empowerment by encouraging their teams to take ownership of their work. Build redundancies into critical systems like objective key results to prevent single points of failure.\n\n\n4️⃣ Continuous learning and improvement\nProvide ongoing training and professional development opportunities for employees. Create a culture that values feedback and encourages employees to seek new information and perspectives, whether in communities of practices, lunch and learns, etc.\n\n\n5️⃣ Embracing small losses to prevent big ones\nEncourage employees to be transparent about mistakes and failures and use these experiences as opportunities for learning and growth in retrospectives and lessons learned workshops. Build regular checkpoints and milestones to prevent significant failures down the road.\n\n\n6️⃣ Dynamic response to change\nPromote examples of agility and responsiveness, where employees are encouraged to think creatively and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Use data and feedback to inform decision-making, and be open to pivoting or changing direction as needed.\nWhat do you need from your organization to be antifragile?\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBeaumont, de. 2021. “PHWINS 2021 Findings.” https://debeaumont.org/phwins/2021-findings/.\n\n\nMulloy, Natalie. 2023. “Regenerative Public Health: Leadership That Values Connection and Belonging.” https://debeaumont.org/news/2023/regenerative-public-health-leadership-that-values-connection-and-belonging/.\n\n\nTaleb, Nassim. 2014.

And I go through this whole like description of my identity. And she is like, Yeah, I hear you. And then she asked again. And I went back with the potato bag, size chip on my shoulder, and basically said, but I appreciate what other experiences are. But I’ve experienced this rejection and that thing, and that the other end then she says, Boy, John, you’re on the north side of Chicago. If you walk outside of this restaurant, and you’re walking down the street, what does anybody see at all? He said, You’re just another black man in the world to them, regardless of those other identities that matter. You’re just another black dude.

And, you know, for me, that’s connection to food and that she was a food service worker, the impact of government and eminent domain, racism within the healthcare system. But then full circle, my grandfather was actually a patient and saw many physicians there in that same hospital system. And, you know, I never he was he wasn’t a big talker.

And one way to make sure everybody’s heard, it just has a facilitator, this is real simple, is have everybody sit and write, sit and think and write for five minutes before instead of just going with whoever stands up or raises their hand or you know, is really good at interrupting or, you know, getting into the flow of conversation, because they’re used to people listening to them, and they’re, they’re more extroverted probably. So just having that pause to say, Come up with your ideas, and then we’re going to share them and you can share them in writing with the person next to you. There’s lots of ways to build that out until it’s shared in the whole group.

    "text": "We all want to realize our true potential and unlock our best selves. This is self-actualization. But what helps organizations achieve self-actualization to deliver equitable and just services and products to communities most historically marginalized? Ronnell Hampton says we like to think it's only nurture - but in his personal experiences and work, he has found it's also more often nature and the built environment. Ronnell Hampton is the Principal Equity Strategy at a large government municipality and the Founder of Growing Greatness.\nHere are highlights from our conversation with Ronnell on the Unmuted Podcast. Listen to the full episode to hear Ronnell talk about his story in foster care, the role of safety in protecting people's narratives, organizational self-actualization, and the role of permaculture design and ecosystem thinking in shaping a culture of justice.\nListen to this episode on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or Amazon Music.\n\nConversation highlights\n\nThe impact of foster care on Ronnell and his calling.\nAha moments that became drivers working in justice and equity.\nWhat self-actualization looks like for Ronnell, the highest form in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\nHow self-actualization can manifest in high-performing organizations to build a culture of justice.\nDiscussion if self-actualization is a privilege and a luxury that only those with social and financial capital can achieve.\nFrameworks in permaculture design and ecosystem thinking to impact the built environment to design sustainable systems.\nWhat can nature and ants teach us about collective movement and organizational designs toward one mission?\nWhat is one thing an individual can do today to influence systemic structure to build a culture of justice?\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\n\n\n“This idea of self-actualization comes through engagement you have to engage with people to self-actualize. When you are alone, you only have yourself to bounce your ideas off to be your control for your testing and your theories and your thinking. But when you engage with folks, you get to see not only if you’re testing your thinking works, but how others people testing and thinking works. And when we’re isolated in community, or an individual space, our ability to comprehend other people’s positions, or even be willing to analyze or consider other people’s position.”\n\n- Ronnell Hampton\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nRonnell Hampton, MA Is a Principal Equity Strategist in a government municipality in Los Angeles, CA. Ronnell's work focuses on the digital divide, food security, and COVID-19 response, as well as supporting the development of a Racial Equity Office. He is also the founder of Growing Greatness, an organization committed to social and environmental justice by providing consultation and customized training for small to midsize organizations that include DEI, Social Justice, Policy, and Personal Development.

    "text": "Hi! I’m Elham Ali, a researcher, storyteller, and climate justice advocate. I help local governments design solutions to community challenges, including climate action, that center people and equity. 🌿\nCurrently, I work as a researcher at Georgetown’s Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation and am pursuing my doctorate (DrPH) in Health Equity and Social Justice at Johns Hopkins. My research focuses on what helps or prevents local governments from implementing equitable policies and systems change for nature-based solutions, specifically green spaces like parks, urban forests, and street trees. I’m also a proud Crown Prince International Scholar from Bahrain 🇧🇭.\nMy career is a bit like halo-halo 🍨, a colorful mix of experiences rooted in service. I started in microfinance and international relations in East Africa, moved into health policy and management, and have spent the past decade helping local and state governments on civic tech and public health initiatives 🏛️. I’ve collaborated with partners at the Inland Empire Opioid Crisis Coalition, New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, City of Los Angeles, and more.\nThrough my previous consultancy, Jumana Design, I helped governments, nonprofits, and startups build more equitable health products and programs. Highlights include improving vaccine communication with a state board of health to build trust with residents, and supporting a $4M federal grant to boost health literacy and vaccine uptake among pregnant Latina/e/o communities. I also advised a state health department on embedding equity-focused research practices, which led to multistate hackathons that increased employee collaboration.\nPreviously, I served as Lead Human-Centered Design Advisor at the Pima County Health Department and supported more than 13 government partners at US Digital Response during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOutside of work, I give back to groups like Statisticians without Borders, DataKind, and Climate Action Tech, and I advocate locally in the Los Angeles Neighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance (LANCSA) and Santa Clarita with Citizens’ Climate Lobby. I love volunteering in my community, including helping out at Santa Clarita’s Community Beautification Day at Valencia Glen Park, where I was honored to be quoted in a local news story.\n\n\n\n\n\nI live in sunny southern California ☀️ with my partner and our two sweet kitties. 💌 I’m always happy to connect so don’t hesitate to reach out!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

When you are alone, you only have yourself to bounce your ideas off to be your control for your testing and your theories and your thinking. But when you engage with folks, you get to see not only if you’re testing your thinking works, but how others people testing and thinking works.

Awkward silences, loud voices dominating, and lack of direction in the conversation. We have all been there. In this episode, we talk with Hunter Gatewood, who shares group agreements that build a culture of power-sharing, safety, and trustworthiness so everyone can take risks without being at risk. Previously a social worker, Hunter Gatewood is the Owner of Signal Key Consulting and an instructor and coach for team leaders.\nHere are highlights from our conversation with Hunter on the Unmuted Podcast. Listen to the full episode to hear Hunter talk about his career start as a social worker, the role of safety in protecting people's narratives, nurturing trust, and fostering healing in teams amidst changing political and social climates.\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or Amazon Music.\n\nConversation highlights\n\nGrowing Beginnings as a social worker in San Francisco, starting a company, and path as an instructor and coach\nThe role of power-sharing in workshops and meetings,\nNurturing safety from being at risk while coaching teams and leaders in change management, and process improvement work\nVisual communication and doodling as a bridge and power level\nThe Six Culture Builders for Team Leaders to build psychological safety and trust\nCulturally and linguistically appropriate builders for a just culture\nHow to foster organizational healing\nManaging change fatigue amid political, social, and economic climates\nWhy being at rest and at pause is important\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\n\n\n“Sharing power is what a lot of opportunity and leadership is about. And it’s definitely what needs to happen. So on a, let’s say, at a micro level in a instruction session on one of my courses or in a coaching, scenario, group coaching, like the one I was just talking about, one way to share power is to make sure everyone’s heard, right, that’s what you were part of what you were alluding to. And one way to make sure everybody’s heard, it just has a facilitator, this is real simple, is have everybody sit and write, sit and think and write for five minutes before instead of just going with whoever stands up or raises their hand or you know, is really good at interrupting or, you know, getting into the flow of conversation, because they’re used to people listening to them, and they’re, they’re more extroverted probably. So just having that pause to say, Come up with your ideas, and then we’re going to share them and you can share them in writing with the person next to you. There’s lots of ways to build that out until it’s shared in the whole group. So that’s one way to help people who is to set that expectation and set and set again, it’s we’re not just gonna start talking. We’re gonna have everybody write something down so that everyone has something to contribute, if they choose to.”\n\n- Hunter Gatewood\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nHunter Gatewood is the Owner of Signal Key Consulting and an instructor and coach for team leaders who helps mission-driven organizations and individuals from grant-makers to hospitals and schools do good better.

And she died from a heart attack in 1953, in route to Houston Negro hospital because her own employer wouldn’t accept her as a patient. And, you know, for me, that’s connection to food and that she was a food service worker, the impact of government and eminent domain, racism within the healthcare system. But then full circle, my grandfather was actually a patient and saw many physicians there in that same hospital system. And, you know, I never he was he wasn’t a big talker. But I’m curious as to what his own perspective was of his own mother’s death, as it relates to being a provider and, you know, in a worker and having to go to receive services at that same place, and I like what that does, and what that really means.”\n\n- Dr. Larissa Estes-White, DrPH\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nLarissa J.

Listen to the full episode to hear John talk about his identity as a Guyanese-Creole American, the role of agency in the Black community, collective hope to bridge community divide, and how to use empathy and vulnerability to create proximity with white peers on issues of race and ethnicity.\nListen to this episode on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or Amazon Music.\n\nConversation highlights\n\nGrowing up as a third culture kid in white dominant communities.\nMoments that helped awaken John to his Black identity.\nHow to foster a legacy and agency for the Black community.\nCollective rage vs Collective hope to bridge divides.\nHow to use empathy and vulnerability to build proximity with white peers on race discussions.\nThe role of coddling and emotional labor in having conversations on race.\nHow to remain connected to our compassionate nature even under the worst circumstances.\nWhat is one thing an individual can do today to increase collective hope in racial reconciliation?\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\n\n\n“So one day she asked me, she said, John, what are you doing to create agency for the black people? And I went to tell her us and yeah, but I hear you, but I’m not an African American. I’m actually I’m a guyanese American, and creole American. And I go through this whole like description of my identity. And she is like, Yeah, I hear you. And then she asked again. And I went back with the potato bag, size chip on my shoulder, and basically said, but I appreciate what other experiences are. But I’ve experienced this rejection and that thing, and that the other end then she says, Boy, John, you’re on the north side of Chicago. If you walk outside of this restaurant, and you’re walking down the street, what does anybody see at all? He said, You’re just another black man in the world to them, regardless of those other identities that matter. You’re just another black dude. So my question back to you is, with what you have, what are you doing to create agency and opportunity understanding for the black people?”\n\n- John Bobb-Semple\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nJohn Bobb-Semple is a Director of Community Engagement at a health and wellness company.

    "text": "At the height of the pandemic, I worked with local and state public health departments to design COVID-19 vaccination and testing products at the speed of need. Colleagues felt traumatized, disconnected, and burnt out (PH WINS data validates this too). (Beaumont 2021) It was like watching your friends go through an out-of-body experience because of this shared, collective trauma.\nSo when I first saw the term antifragility (coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb) in an article by Dr. Marissa J. Levine, I was intrigued. (Taleb 2014; Mulloy 2023) Not because humans can thrive amidst adversity but because the conditions organizations foster for their staff to prosper at work matter even more.\nAntifragility is about having more chaos and stress in our daily lives to test our institutions. While resilience is about bouncing back from adversity (like recovering from an injury), antifragility is about getting stronger and thriving in the face of challenges. For example, when you exercise, your muscles experience stress and strain, causing tiny tears in the fibers. However, when you rest and recover, your body repairs the damage and becomes stronger than before.\nTo be antifragile, organizations need to do some prereqs:\n\n1️⃣ Culture of experimentation to embrace uncertainty\nAntifragility requires a willingness to experiment and learn. Employees need to feel safe to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas without fear of losing their jobs or being reprimanded. Create a culture that celebrates continuous iterations of work-in-progress deliverables and recognizes that failure is necessary for learning.\n\n\n2️⃣ Resilience and adaptability\nBuild cross-functional teams that can quickly adapt to changing circumstances with role charters. Encourage employees to be flexible and open-minded by applying principles from human-centered design, and provide coaching to support ongoing learning and development.\n\n\n3️⃣ Redundancy and decentralization\nDevelop and train leaders and managers to value decentralization and empowerment by encouraging their teams to take ownership of their work. Build redundancies into critical systems like objective key results to prevent single points of failure.\n\n\n4️⃣ Continuous learning and improvement\nProvide ongoing training and professional development opportunities for employees. Create a culture that values feedback and encourages employees to seek new information and perspectives, whether in communities of practices, lunch and learns, etc.\n\n\n5️⃣ Embracing small losses to prevent big ones\nEncourage employees to be transparent about mistakes and failures and use these experiences as opportunities for learning and growth in retrospectives and lessons learned workshops. Build regular checkpoints and milestones to prevent significant failures down the road.\n\n\n6️⃣ Dynamic response to change\nPromote examples of agility and responsiveness, where employees are encouraged to think creatively and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Use data and feedback to inform decision-making, and be open to pivoting or changing direction as needed.\nWhat do you need from your organization to be antifragile?\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBeaumont, de. 2021. “PHWINS 2021 Findings.” https://debeaumont.org/phwins/2021-findings/.\n\n\nMulloy, Natalie. 2023. “Regenerative Public Health: Leadership That Values Connection and Belonging.” https://debeaumont.org/news/2023/regenerative-public-health-leadership-that-values-connection-and-belonging/.\n\n\nTaleb, Nassim. 2014.

We developed a theory of change to improve health outcomes and interviewed program staff while reviewing past testimonials and feedback from lactating individuals. We also analyzed historical data on lactation room usage, identifying three key themes for the program: education, privacy, and access to breast pump accessories.\nOur research revealed that the program increased breastfeeding rates among individuals who had not traditionally breastfed, which contributed to lower rates of gastrointestinal disorders in infants and more frequent well-baby visits. The evaluation also highlighted other positive health outcomes, including reduced feelings of shame and stigma around breastfeeding in the workplace."

Fertisat offers precise recommendations tailored to the needs of each field, which can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in several ways. My goal was to evaluate its potential for carbon sequestration in Africa—a region with significant untapped potential.\nBy minimizing excess nitrogen use, it cuts down on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a highly potent greenhouse gas. It also boosts crop yields by improving the efficiency of fertilization, which lowers the emissions per kilogram of crop produced.

In collaboration with a team, I also evaluated GHG intensities and model outcomes, using diverse data sources to provide actionable insights for the company’s sustainability initiatives.\nThe analysis focused on measuring the kilograms of CO2 equivalent saved per hectare of farmland using Fertisat. I compared two scenarios: the baseline model, which looked at emissions from current agricultural practices without Fertisat, and the solution model, which projected emissions with the use of Fertisat.\nI also focused on the agricultural sector, particularly small and large-scale farms in African countries where SOWIT operates. The projection timeframe extended from 2024 to 2050, assessing the potential impact over the next several decades."

We matched each ingredient to one of the Cool Food Calculator's categories and calculated its greenhouse gas emissions, then summed those emissions for each recipe. To set our climate-impact labels, we plotted every recipe's total emissions in a strip plot and looked for natural breaks in the distribution—these breaks gave us clearer cutoffs than standard methods like tertiles or k-means. Finally, I helped turn those cutoffs into green, yellow, and red labels so we could easily see which recipes had low, medium, or high climate impact.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code on GitHub is stored in a private repository and cannot be shared publicly due to proprietary data.\n\n\nI designed the plan for collecting and analyzing dining ingredient purchases and student survey responses, then gathered, cleaned, and transformed the data from before and after the study.

View code on Github\n\n\nAmid strong public opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations in schools, the Washington State Board of Health needed data-driven insights to understand public satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and factors influencing vaccine acceptance. Collaborating with U.S. Digital Response, I worked alongside Dr. Chimobi Ucha, a computer and data scientist, and the Board’s Communications Manager and Policy Team to analyze 80,000 public comments from emails, survey responses, and public meeting transcripts.\nMy approach began with sentiment analysis and text mining of all feedback, using R for text mining and sentiment analysis. My teammate and I created a phased pipeline to process comments from town meeting transcripts, emails, and survey responses, using a combination of R libraries. The analysis pipeline consisted of a scraper, relevancy model, sentiment model, text analysis model, and thematic analysis, which allowed us to classify comments as positive, neutral, or negative.\nWe focused on identifying key names, organizations, and keywords associated with misinformation campaigns and used frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify common themes. A random sample of comments was further analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti and Miro. This systematic approach significantly improved our precision-recall score from 34% to 91%-92%, allowing us to uncover the underlying beliefs, values, and attitudes driving public opinion on the vaccine mandate."
