This proposal led to the formation of a technical advisory group in December 2021.

View code on Github\n\n\nAmid strong public opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations in schools, the Washington State Board of Health needed data-driven insights to understand public satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and factors influencing vaccine acceptance. Collaborating with U.S. Digital Response, I worked alongside Dr. Chimobi Ucha, a computer and data scientist, and the Board’s Communications Manager and Policy Team to analyze 80,000 public comments from emails, survey responses, and public meeting transcripts.\nMy approach began with sentiment analysis and text mining of all feedback, using R for text mining and sentiment analysis. My teammate and I created a phased pipeline to process comments from town meeting transcripts, emails, and survey responses, using a combination of R libraries. The analysis pipeline consisted of a scraper, relevancy model, sentiment model, text analysis model, and thematic analysis, which allowed us to classify comments as positive, neutral, or negative.\nWe focused on identifying key names, organizations, and keywords associated with misinformation campaigns and used frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify common themes. A random sample of comments was further analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti and Miro. This systematic approach significantly improved our precision-recall score from 34% to 91%-92%, allowing us to uncover the underlying beliefs, values, and attitudes driving public opinion on the vaccine mandate."

I managed more than 30 volunteers to deliver evidence-based research, including comparative analysis, contextual inquiry, usability testing, interviewing, and survey analysis, increasing governments’ confidence and connection with their communities. I implemented cognitive biases in writing and communication to influence health and care-seeking behaviors in social media posts and patient education brochures. I developed, edited, and gathered information to create clear, concise, and compelling materials for key stakeholders and audiences, including press releases, speeches, blogs, op-eds, backgrounders, talking points, scripts, reports, stories, and website copy. I built governments’ capacity to integrate literacy and equity into digital media through website templates and a toolkit."

I classified these ingredients according to the Cool Food Calculator categories for accurate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) calculations. Emissions for each ingredient were calculated based on its category and then aggregated at the recipe level. Together, we visualized the GHGE data using a strip plot to identify natural breaks in the emission distribution, which provided more precise thresholds than traditional methods like tertiles or k-means clustering. I then helped define the thresholds for climate impact labels (green, yellow, red), categorizing foods based on their relative climate impact.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nView the code on GitHub (private repository—please email me for access).\n\n\nI designed the data collection analysis, collected, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed dining ingredient purchasing and student survey data before and after the study. This included preparing tables for publication on demographics and descriptive statistics relevant to food insecurity, diet quality, and types of food consumption. I managed data collection and validation processes, working closely with dining team members to make sure the accuracy of variables and data collection methods. I conducted preliminary exploratory analyses to understand survey respondent characteristics and outcome variables, and wrote methods draft for publication."

We developed a theory of change to improve health outcomes and interviewed program staff while reviewing past testimonials and feedback from lactating individuals. We also analyzed historical data on lactation room usage, identifying three key themes for the program: education, privacy, and access to breast pump accessories.\nOur research revealed that the program increased breastfeeding rates among individuals who had not traditionally breastfed, which contributed to lower rates of gastrointestinal disorders in infants and more frequent well-baby visits. The evaluation also highlighted other positive health outcomes, including reduced feelings of shame and stigma around breastfeeding in the workplace."

In collaboration with a team, I also evaluated GHG intensities and model outcomes, using diverse data sources to provide actionable insights for the company’s sustainability initiatives.\nThe analysis focused on measuring the kilograms of CO2 equivalent saved per hectare of farmland using Fertisat. I compared two scenarios: the baseline model, which looked at emissions from current agricultural practices without Fertisat, and the solution model, which projected emissions with the use of Fertisat.\nI also focused on the agricultural sector, particularly small and large-scale farms in African countries where SOWIT operates. The projection timeframe extended from 2024 to 2050, assessing the potential impact over the next several decades."

    "text": "At the height of the pandemic, I worked with local and state public health departments to design COVID-19 vaccination and testing products at the speed of need. Colleagues felt traumatized, disconnected, and burnt out (PH WINS data validates this too). (Beaumont 2021) It was like watching your friends go through an out-of-body experience because of this shared, collective trauma.\nSo when I first saw the term antifragility (coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb) in an article by Dr. Marissa J. Levine, I was intrigued. (Taleb 2014; Mulloy 2023) Not because humans can thrive amidst adversity but because the conditions organizations foster for their staff to prosper at work matter even more.\nAntifragility is about having more chaos and stress in our daily lives to test our institutions. While resilience is about bouncing back from adversity (like recovering from an injury), antifragility is about getting stronger and thriving in the face of challenges. For example, when you exercise, your muscles experience stress and strain, causing tiny tears in the fibers. However, when you rest and recover, your body repairs the damage and becomes stronger than before.\nTo be antifragile, organizations need to do some prereqs:\n\n1️⃣ Culture of experimentation to embrace uncertainty\nAntifragility requires a willingness to experiment and learn. Employees need to feel safe to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas without fear of losing their jobs or being reprimanded. Create a culture that celebrates continuous iterations of work-in-progress deliverables and recognizes that failure is necessary for learning.\n\n\n2️⃣ Resilience and adaptability\nBuild cross-functional teams that can quickly adapt to changing circumstances with role charters. Encourage employees to be flexible and open-minded by applying principles from human-centered design, and provide coaching to support ongoing learning and development.\n\n\n3️⃣ Redundancy and decentralization\nDevelop and train leaders and managers to value decentralization and empowerment by encouraging their teams to take ownership of their work. Build redundancies into critical systems like objective key results to prevent single points of failure.\n\n\n4️⃣ Continuous learning and improvement\nProvide ongoing training and professional development opportunities for employees. Create a culture that values feedback and encourages employees to seek new information and perspectives, whether in communities of practices, lunch and learns, etc.\n\n\n5️⃣ Embracing small losses to prevent big ones\nEncourage employees to be transparent about mistakes and failures and use these experiences as opportunities for learning and growth in retrospectives and lessons learned workshops. Build regular checkpoints and milestones to prevent significant failures down the road.\n\n\n6️⃣ Dynamic response to change\nPromote examples of agility and responsiveness, where employees are encouraged to think creatively and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. Use data and feedback to inform decision-making, and be open to pivoting or changing direction as needed.\nWhat do you need from your organization to be antifragile?\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nBeaumont, de. 2021. “PHWINS 2021 Findings.” https://debeaumont.org/phwins/2021-findings/.\n\n\nMulloy, Natalie. 2023. “Regenerative Public Health: Leadership That Values Connection and Belonging.” https://debeaumont.org/news/2023/regenerative-public-health-leadership-that-values-connection-and-belonging/.\n\n\nTaleb, Nassim. 2014.

And I went to tell her us and yeah, but I hear you, but I’m not an African American. I’m actually I’m a guyanese American, and creole American. And I go through this whole like description of my identity. And she is like, Yeah, I hear you. And then she asked again. And I went back with the potato bag, size chip on my shoulder, and basically said, but I appreciate what other experiences are. But I’ve experienced this rejection and that thing, and that the other end then she says, Boy, John, you’re on the north side of Chicago. If you walk outside of this restaurant, and you’re walking down the street, what does anybody see at all? He said, You’re just another black man in the world to them, regardless of those other identities that matter. You’re just another black dude.

And one way to make sure everybody’s heard, it just has a facilitator, this is real simple, is have everybody sit and write, sit and think and write for five minutes before instead of just going with whoever stands up or raises their hand or you know, is really good at interrupting or, you know, getting into the flow of conversation, because they’re used to people listening to them, and they’re, they’re more extroverted probably. So just having that pause to say, Come up with your ideas, and then we’re going to share them and you can share them in writing with the person next to you. There’s lots of ways to build that out until it’s shared in the whole group. So that’s one way to help people who is to set that expectation and set and set again, it’s we’re not just gonna start talking. We’re gonna have everybody write something down so that everyone has something to contribute, if they choose to.”\n\n- Hunter Gatewood\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nHunter Gatewood is the Owner of Signal Key Consulting and an instructor and coach for team leaders who helps mission-driven organizations and individuals from grant-makers to hospitals and schools do good better.

    "text": "Behind every ingredient, bite, and meal we eat is a farmer’s story. 500M smallholder farms are supporting 2B people globally. Yet, the majority of the world's hungry are farmers. U.S. agriculture today appears to be as segregated as it was a century ago, with farmers of color at a significant disadvantage. Today, they cultivate less than half of one percent of the country's farmland. Dr. Larissa Estes-White, DrPH shares her family legacy in farming across the U.S. and Philippines. She tells stories of racist land ownership, food sovereignty, and hopes to build a just circular food economy. Dr. Estes-White is the Executive Director of ALL IN Alameda County.\nHere are highlights from our conversation with Dr. Estes-White on the Unmuted Podcast. Listen to the full episode to hear Dr. Estes-White talk about her family's history and legacy in tenant farming, stories of racism towards food producers and land ownership in the US, and her important work to build a just and sustainable circular food economy.\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or Amazon Music.\n\nConversation highlights\n\nDr. Estes-White's lived experience, family heritage across the U.S. and the Philippines in farming\nDrawing on the past toward a sovereign food future: Stories of racism towards food workers and producers\nFood as power, as a means of leverage to submit to colonizing power\nFood as political and stories in tenant farming\nFood as culture, power back to farmers of color, and culturally-relevant recipes\nThe work of ALL IN Alameda County in the circular food economy, Recipes4Health, and Place-based Strategies\nLessons learned in building a just and circular food economy\nNews and trends today, including White House convening on food security and hunger, Universal free lunch, and food prices and inflation in today's economy\nWhat an individual can do today to participate and engage in a just circular food economy\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\n\n\n“My great grandmother, who was a cook at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Houston, she owned a home within walking distance of the hospital, which was destroyed eventually when a freeway was put in. And she died from a heart attack in 1953, in route to Houston Negro hospital because her own employer wouldn’t accept her as a patient. And, you know, for me, that’s connection to food and that she was a food service worker, the impact of government and eminent domain, racism within the healthcare system. But then full circle, my grandfather was actually a patient and saw many physicians there in that same hospital system. And, you know, I never he was he wasn’t a big talker. But I’m curious as to what his own perspective was of his own mother’s death, as it relates to being a provider and, you know, in a worker and having to go to receive services at that same place, and I like what that does, and what that really means.”\n\n- Dr. Larissa Estes-White, DrPH\n\n\nEpisode transcript\nDownload the episode transcript (PDF).\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nLarissa J.

View code on Github\n\n\nAmid strong public opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations in schools, the Washington State Board of Health needed data-driven insights to understand public satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and factors influencing vaccine acceptance. Collaborating with U.S. Digital Response, I worked alongside Dr. Chimobi Ucha, a computer and data scientist, and the Board’s Communications Manager and Policy Team to analyze 80,000 public comments from emails, survey responses, and public meeting transcripts.\nMy approach began with sentiment analysis and text mining of all feedback, using R for text mining and sentiment analysis. My teammate and I created a phased pipeline to process comments from town meeting transcripts, emails, and survey responses, using a combination of R libraries. The analysis pipeline consisted of a scraper, relevancy model, sentiment model, text analysis model, and thematic analysis, which allowed us to classify comments as positive, neutral, or negative.\nWe focused on identifying key names, organizations, and keywords associated with misinformation campaigns and used frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify common themes. A random sample of comments was further analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti and Miro. This systematic approach significantly improved our precision-recall score from 34% to 91%-92%, allowing us to uncover the underlying beliefs, values, and attitudes driving public opinion on the vaccine mandate."

I began by defining the project scope, outlining deliverables, setting the schedule, identifying potential risks and dependencies, and establishing the roles within the team. We then moved to concept testing, where I coordinated sessions with a panel of residents and clinicians to gather insights on the draft educational flyers. This testing revealed the need for simple language, messages that matched patient values, personal stories, and trusted sources.\nUsing these insights, I developed clear recommendations for the design and content of the materials. I reviewed and edited the flyers and website content to make sure they followed FDA guidelines and health literacy standards. I also translated the patient education materials into Tagalog and Arabic to reach more communities. To measure the campaign’s effectiveness, I advised on using Google Analytics to track how people interacted with the content."

I established a project schedule with Gantt charts to facilitate clear communication and problem-solving during weekly meetings. Additionally, I collaborated with an IT team in France to develop wireframes and content in Drupal that matched the new brand identity and design system, aligned with the parent company’s brand guidelines."

The global food system, from production to waste, accounts for about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Meat from cattle (33%), dairy (19%), and other animal meats (9%) contribute over 60% of the projected global temperature rise from food systems by 2030. Reducing red meat and dairy consumption in high-income countries like the U.S., where intake far exceeds dietary guidelines, is essential. Universities offer an influential hub to drive this change by influencing student behavior through their dining services. Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future implemented climate labels in dining hall menue to encourage students to choose lower-GHGE foods, but their effectiveness, particularly in university settings. Targeting Generation Z students, who are more inclined towards plant-based diets, the center’s study aimed to assess the impact of climate change menu labels on promoting sustainable food choices and reducing climate anxiety. My role was to collect recipes and all ingredients for the study, and develop a model for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of recipes over a four-week period in two dining halls at a private university in Maryland."

I classified these ingredients according to the Cool Food Calculator categories for accurate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) calculations. Emissions for each ingredient were calculated based on its category and then aggregated at the recipe level. Together, we visualized the GHGE data using a strip plot to identify natural breaks in the emission distribution, which provided more precise thresholds than traditional methods like tertiles or k-means clustering. I then helped define the thresholds for climate impact labels (green, yellow, red), categorizing foods based on their relative climate impact.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nView the code on GitHub (private repository—please email me for access).\n\n\nI designed the data collection analysis, collected, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed dining ingredient purchasing and student survey data before and after the study. This included preparing tables for publication on demographics and descriptive statistics relevant to food insecurity, diet quality, and types of food consumption. I managed data collection and validation processes, working closely with dining team members to make sure the accuracy of variables and data collection methods. I conducted preliminary exploratory analyses to understand survey respondent characteristics and outcome variables, and wrote methods draft for publication."
