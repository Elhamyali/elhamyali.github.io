This proposal led to the formation of a technical advisory group in December 2021.

View code on Github\n\n\nAmid strong public opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations in schools, the Washington State Board of Health needed data-driven insights to understand public satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and factors influencing vaccine acceptance. Collaborating with U.S. Digital Response, I worked alongside Dr. Chimobi Ucha, a computer and data scientist, and the Board’s Communications Manager and Policy Team to analyze 80,000 public comments from emails, survey responses, and public meeting transcripts.\nMy approach began with sentiment analysis and text mining of all feedback, using R for text mining and sentiment analysis. My teammate and I created a phased pipeline to process comments from town meeting transcripts, emails, and survey responses, using a combination of R libraries. The analysis pipeline consisted of a scraper, relevancy model, sentiment model, text analysis model, and thematic analysis, which allowed us to classify comments as positive, neutral, or negative.\nWe focused on identifying key names, organizations, and keywords associated with misinformation campaigns and used frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify common themes. A random sample of comments was further analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti and Miro. This systematic approach significantly improved our precision-recall score from 34% to 91%-92%, allowing us to uncover the underlying beliefs, values, and attitudes driving public opinion on the vaccine mandate."

I managed more than 30 volunteers to deliver evidence-based research, including comparative analysis, contextual inquiry, usability testing, interviewing, and survey analysis, increasing governments’ confidence and connection with their communities. I implemented cognitive biases in writing and communication to influence health and care-seeking behaviors in social media posts and patient education brochures. I developed, edited, and gathered information to create clear, concise, and compelling materials for key stakeholders and audiences, including press releases, speeches, blogs, op-eds, backgrounders, talking points, scripts, reports, stories, and website copy. I built governments’ capacity to integrate literacy and equity into digital media through website templates and a toolkit."

I classified these ingredients according to the Cool Food Calculator categories for accurate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) calculations. Emissions for each ingredient were calculated based on its category and then aggregated at the recipe level. Together, we visualized the GHGE data using a strip plot to identify natural breaks in the emission distribution, which provided more precise thresholds than traditional methods like tertiles or k-means clustering. I then helped define the thresholds for climate impact labels (green, yellow, red), categorizing foods based on their relative climate impact.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nView the code on GitHub (private repository—please email me for access).\n\n\nI designed the data collection analysis, collected, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed dining ingredient purchasing and student survey data before and after the study. This included preparing tables for publication on demographics and descriptive statistics relevant to food insecurity, diet quality, and types of food consumption. I managed data collection and validation processes, working closely with dining team members to make sure the accuracy of variables and data collection methods. I conducted preliminary exploratory analyses to understand survey respondent characteristics and outcome variables, and wrote methods draft for publication."

Key study findings included:\n\nMinimal differences between baseline and intervention periods, except for a notable increase in purchases due to a special event.\nPlant protein intake increased slightly post-intervention, while vegetable intake decreased. Overall diet quality scores showed no significant change.\nOne-third of students noticed the climate labels, but the majority felt neutral about them.

We developed a theory of change to improve health outcomes and interviewed program staff while reviewing past testimonials and feedback from lactating individuals. We also analyzed historical data on lactation room usage, identifying three key themes for the program: education, privacy, and access to breast pump accessories.\nOur research revealed that the program increased breastfeeding rates among individuals who had not traditionally breastfed, which contributed to lower rates of gastrointestinal disorders in infants and more frequent well-baby visits. The evaluation also highlighted other positive health outcomes, including reduced feelings of shame and stigma around breastfeeding in the workplace."

Fertisat offers precise recommendations tailored to the needs of each field, which can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in several ways. My goal was to evaluate its potential for carbon sequestration in Africa—a region with significant untapped potential.\nBy minimizing excess nitrogen use, it cuts down on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a highly potent greenhouse gas.

I conducted a Life Cycle Analysis and reviewed existing literature to assess the carbon sequestration potential of various crops, such as wheat and corn, in the African market. In collaboration with a team, I also evaluated GHG intensities and model outcomes, using diverse data sources to provide actionable insights for the company’s sustainability initiatives.\nThe analysis focused on measuring the kilograms of CO2 equivalent saved per hectare of farmland using Fertisat. I compared two scenarios: the baseline model, which looked at emissions from current agricultural practices without Fertisat, and the solution model, which projected emissions with the use of Fertisat.\nI also focused on the agricultural sector, particularly small and large-scale farms in African countries where SOWIT operates. The projection timeframe extended from 2024 to 2050, assessing the potential impact over the next several decades."
