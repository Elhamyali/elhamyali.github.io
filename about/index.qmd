Hi! I'm Elham Ali, a researcher, storyteller, and climate justice advocate.

My career is a bit like <a href="https://www.kollectivehustle.com/blog/the-origin-of-the-halo-halo-dessert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halo-halo</a> 🍨, a colorful mix of experiences. I started in microfinance and international relations in East Africa, moved into health policy and management, and have spent the past decade helping local and state governments improve civic tech and public health 🏛️. I've worked with teams at the Inland Empire Opioid Crisis Coalition, New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, City of Los Angeles, and more.

Today, I'm a researcher at Georgetown's <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/person/elham-ali/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation</a>, where I help local governments design solutions to local challenges including for climate action that center people and equity. 🌿

I'm also a <a href="https://www.cpisp.bh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crown Prince International Scholar</a> from Bahrain 🇧🇭 and a doctoral student (DrPH) in Health Equity and Social Justice at Johns Hopkins University 🎓, studying what helps or prevents local government from implementing equitable policies and systems changes for green spaces like parks, urban forests, and street trees.

Through my consultancy, Jumana Design, I helped governments, nonprofits, and startups build more equitable health programs and products. Highlights include improving vaccine communication with a state board of health to build trust with residents, and supporting a \$4M federal grant to boost health literacy and vaccine uptake among pregnant Latina/e/o communities. I also advised a state health department on embedding equity-focused research practices, which led to multistate hackathons that increased employee engagement and collaboration.

Previously, I served as Lead Human-Centered Design Advisor at the Pima County Health Department and supported more than 13 government partners at US Digital Response during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I stay active with groups like Statisticians without Borders, DataKind, and Climate Action Tech, and I advocate locally in my city of <a href="https://signalscv.com/2025/06/volunteers-and-city-make-mulch-ado-about-beautification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Clarita</a> with <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens' Climate Lobby.</a>

I live in southern California ☀️ with my husband and two sweet kitties. 💌 Always happy to connect so don't hesitate to reach out!
