When I find time, I draw comics about the life of a wholesome potato named Spud. Follow Spud's adventures as they navigates everyday life with humor, heart, and a little bit of quirkiness. These comics are a lighthearted escape, celebrating kindness, resilience, and the simple joys of being a potato. Perfect for anyone who needs a smile or a reminder that even the smallest things can have a big impact.
