## Challenge

Climate change is a critical public health threat that requires urgent
action. The global food system, from production to waste, accounts for
about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Meat from cattle
(33%), dairy (19%), and other animal meats (9%) contribute over 60% of
the projected global temperature rise from food systems by 2030.
Reducing red meat and dairy consumption in high-income countries like
the U.S., where intake far exceeds dietary guidelines, is essential.
Universities offer an influential hub to drive this change by
influencing student behavior through their dining services. Johns
Hopkins Center for a Livable Future implemented climate labels in dining
hall menue to encourage students to choose lower-GHGE foods, but their
effectiveness, particularly in university settings. Targeting Generation
Z students, who are more inclined towards plant-based diets, the
center's study aimed to assess the impact of climate change menu labels
on promoting sustainable food choices and reducing climate anxiety. My
role was to collect recipes and all ingredients for the study, and
develop a model for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
recipes over a four-week period in two dining halls at a private
university in Maryland.

Working with a colleague, I extracted over 650 menu items containing
26,277 ingredients from all recipes using Python libraries. I classified
these ingredients according to the Cool Food Calculator categories for
accurate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) calculations. Emissions for
each ingredient were calculated based on its category and then
aggregated at the recipe level. Together, we visualized the GHGE data
using a strip plot to identify natural breaks in the emission
distribution, which provided more precise thresholds than traditional
methods like tertiles or k-means clustering. I then helped define the
thresholds for climate impact labels (green, yellow, red), categorizing
foods based on their relative climate impact.

I designed the data collection analysis, collected, cleaned,
transformed, and analyzed dining ingredient purchasing and student
survey data before and after the study. This included preparing tables
for publication on demographics and descriptive statistics relevant to
food insecurity, diet quality, and types of food consumption. I managed
data collection and validation processes, working closely with dining
team members to make sure the accuracy of variables and data collection
methods. I conducted preliminary exploratory analyses to understand
survey respondent characteristics and outcome variables, and wrote
methods draft for publication.

## Results

By quickly gathering over 600 recipes, I saved the Center hundreds of
hours in staff time and resources, resulting in a more efficient and
effective research process. Key study findings included:

-   Minimal differences between baseline and intervention periods,
    except for a notable increase in purchases due to a special event.

-   Plant protein intake increased slightly post-intervention, while
    vegetable intake decreased. Overall diet quality scores showed no
    significant change.

-   One-third of students noticed the climate labels, but the majority
    felt neutral about them. Many students reported that the labels did
    not influence their food choices or concerns about climate impact.
