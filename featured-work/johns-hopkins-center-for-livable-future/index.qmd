## Challenge

From the study: "Climate change is a critical public health threat that
requires urgent action. The global food system, from production to
waste, accounts for about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions
(GHGE). Meat from cattle (33%), dairy (19%), and other animal meats (9%)
contribute over 60% of the projected global temperature rise from food
systems by 2030. Reducing red meat and dairy consumption in high-income
countries like the U.S., where intake far exceeds dietary guidelines, is
essential. Universities offer an influential hub to drive this change by
influencing student behavior through their dining services. Johns
Hopkins Center for a Livable Future implemented climate labels in dining
hall menue to encourage students to choose lower-GHGE foods, but their
effectiveness, particularly in university settings. Targeting Generation
Z students, who are more inclined towards plant-based diets, the
center's study aimed to assess the impact of climate change menu labels
on promoting sustainable food choices and reducing climate anxiety."

My role was to collect recipes and all ingredients for the study, and
co-develop a model for calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
recipes over a four-week period in two dining halls at a private
university in Maryland.

I worked with a colleague to pull out all 650+ menu items and their
26,277 ingredients using Python. We matched each ingredient to one of
the Cool Food Calculator\'s categories and calculated its greenhouse gas
emissions, then summed those emissions for each recipe. To set our
climate-impact labels, we plotted every recipe\'s total emissions in a
strip plot and looked for natural breaks in the distribution---these
breaks gave us clearer cutoffs than standard methods like tertiles or
k-means. Finally, I helped turn those cutoffs into green, yellow, and
red labels so we could easily see which recipes had low, medium, or high
climate impact.

I designed the plan for collecting and analyzing dining ingredient
purchases and student survey responses, then gathered, cleaned, and
transformed the data from before and after the study. I created tables
for publication that summarize participant demographics and key measures
of food insecurity, diet quality, and types of foods consumed. I managed
the data collection and validation process, collaborating with dining
staff to confirm that our variables and methods were accurate. Finally,
I ran exploratory analyses to profile survey respondents and outcome
measures, and drafted the study\'s methods section for publication.

## Results

Gathering over 600 recipes saved the Center hundreds of staff hours and
made our research much more efficient. Key findings:

-   Purchases stayed about the same before and after the intervention,
    except for a spike during a special event.

-   Plant protein intake ticked up slightly, while vegetable intake
    dipped; overall diet quality didn\'t change.

-   About one in three students noticed the climate labels, but most
    felt neutral and said the labels didn\'t affect their food choices
    or concern for climate impact.
