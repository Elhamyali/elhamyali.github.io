## Challenge

{{ challenge_intro }}

{{ organization }} needed support in developing a {{ project_name }} to {{ project_goal }}. The site needed to present {{ key_content }} and connect users to valuable resources. The content was organized around key thematic areas: {{ thematic_areas }}.

## Approach

As the project lead, I managed and coached a team of researchers, UX designers, and content strategists. I established inclusive partnerships with various stakeholders, including {{ stakeholders }}.

I conducted user research, including {{ research_methods }}, to understand how users interact with the site's content. Working closely with the UX designer, I helped shape the site’s information architecture to be intuitive and accessible. I developed content guidelines to ensure the site communicated with {{ content_tone }}. This included {{ content_details }}.

## Results

Our work demonstrated the importance of data in driving conversations about {{ topic }} and empowering community members to engage with local partners. Within {{ timeframe }}, my team delivered prototypes and a new information architecture that {{ client_name }} put into production. Key deliverables include the following:

- [{{ deliverable1 }}]({{ deliverable1_link }})
- [{{ deliverable2 }}]({{ deliverable2_link }})
