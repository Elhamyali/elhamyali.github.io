## Testimonial

*"Elham, I had to take my HCD training. Your training is amazing! Elham was a game-changer in our approach to human-centered design in our county. Her creativity and expertise in organizational equity were pivotal when we developed and implemented four major health literacy projects to improve COVID-19 vaccination health literacy among Latina/o/e pregnant people under a $4M federal grant. Elham's remarkable ability to strategize and pivot when needed, combined with her rigorous research and human-centered design approach, has not only improved our department's capabilities but also established a sustainable model for health equity. Her leadership in forming partnerships and her visionary approach to integrating design thinking into our work processes have left a lasting impact on Pima County Health Department."*
