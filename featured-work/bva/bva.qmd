## Challenge

[Bureau Veritas North America](https://www.bvna.com/) (BVNA), a division of the \$50B publicly-traded Bureau Veritas, was struggling with a large-scale merger and acquisition project that involved rebranding six acquired companies. They had recently lost a key project manager, causing delays and resulting in deliverables that did not meet stakeholder expectations. Facing significant misalignment and siloed communication across teams, BVNA, along with Marketri, needed a dedicated project manager who could bridge these gaps, realign the project scope, and ensure the rebrand met the parent company's guidelines.

As a Senior Project Manager with Marketri, I stepped in to lead this high-stakes project. I worked to align cross-functional stakeholders on a cohesive content architecture that accurately represented the new brand. I collaborated closely with a global team to meet the parent company's standards, managing a team of graphic designers and copywriters to produce hundreds of new web copies, flyers, and a unified website --- all delivered on time, under budget, and within scope.

## Approach

To create a people-centric approach while merging six companies with diverse services and needs, I combined an enterprise design thinking process with a waterfall methodology. I started by auditing the project to identify and resolve delays and align stakeholder expectations and communication. To clarify the project's goals, I interviewed key stakeholders from the communications and marketing teams to define what success would look like for the rebrand.

I streamlined the team structure, hired new talent, and set up an efficient process for creating and delivering web copy, flyers, and brochures. I also co-created a site map and information architecture to represent the combined services of all merged companies on the new website so that the content was consistent and cohesive.

I oversaw the creation and approval of all website content and marketing materials using a structured process. I established a project schedule with Gantt charts to facilitate clear communication and problem-solving during weekly meetings. Additionally, I collaborated with an IT team in France to develop wireframes and content in Drupal that matched the new brand identity and design system, aligned with the parent company's brand guidelines.

## Results

This effort led to the timely delivery of over 500 rebranded collateral pieces and six customized communication plans. My meticulous documentation and quality assurance process enabled the team to deliver modular, service-oriented designs and content. As a result, Bureau Veritas North America successfully launched its rebrand in 2019. The new website can be viewed [here](https://www.bvna.com/) or in the video below.

## Testimonial

*"Elham was exceptional in every way. Her project management is a 10 out of 10. Her communication is the same. She managed a highly complex project and made it look easy and it was not. She always had a positive attitude and kept her cool even during highly stressful periods in the project. Her team loved her. She represented Marketri so very well and I'm grateful. The project was on-time, on-budget and very profitable! Thank you Elham!!"*
