## Key points

-   Join a **national Johns Hopkins study** anytime from **November 14, 2025 – March 31, 2026** to share your professional insights and experiences on how your local government plans and delivers **equitable parks and green spaces**. You can take part by completing an online survey and/or joining a virtual interview.

-   This study is open to anyone 18 or older who works with **U.S. local governments (city, county, or township)** on parks, green spaces, climate, sustainability, or related community issues.

-   When you participate, you’ll receive a **gift card (\$\$\$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both (you can also choose to donate it). You’ll also get a summary of national findings you can use in your work and authorship credit in published results if you’d like.

## What is this study about?

Across the United States, cities, counties, and townships are investing in **parks and green spaces** as essential infrastructure to improve community health, equity, and climate resilience. But what helps local governments make that happen and what gets in the way?

In this study, we're looking at both sides of that question:

-   **Internal readiness**: how prepared local governments are to deliver equitable parks and green space policies and practices

-   **External pressures**: the outside factors that influence that work, from funding to political priorities

**Local governments are at the center of this story.** With control over zoning, land use, and infrastructure investments, they shape how communities adapt to climate risks and who benefits from those decisions. By sharing your experience, you can help identify what internal conditions, partnerships, and resources make equitable action possible.

We’re also reviewing park and green space policies from cities nationwide to understand how equity shows up in practice and where gaps remain. These insights will guide practical recommendations for how local governments can design and sustain climate-ready, community-centered green space strategies.

This research is part of a **doctoral dissertation at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}**, led by student researcher Elham Ali, MPH, PMP, under the supervision of Jill Marsteller, PhD, MPP (IRB00034299).

The [Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional-review-board){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has reviewed this study and determined it is **“not human subjects research”** under DHHS regulations 45 CFR 46.102. That means we’re asking about your professional perspectives of your organization, not private or personal information. Your responses will stay confidential.

## When is this study happening?

The study will run from **November 14, 2025 through March 31, 2026.**

You can join at any time during this period and participate once or in both parts (survey and interview) depending on your availability.

## Who can participate?

We’re looking for people who:

-   Are **18 or older**

-   Work in **a U.S. city, county, or township government**

-   Work on **parks, green spaces, climate, sustainability, or related community issues**

We encourage **three or more people from each organization** to join so we can hear different perspectives but we also know that many environmental and sustainability offices are small. Even if you’re a *team of one*, your voice matters.

## Why should I join?

When you participate, you’ll:

-   Share what **your local government needs** to make parks and green space equity possible. Your insights will shape the supports to better design and deliver parks and green spaces that are fair, effective, and community-centered.

-   Receive a **summary of the national findings** you can use in your work to benchmark readiness and progress

-   Receive **authorship credit** if you’d like

-   Get a **gift card (\$\$\$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both. We can send gift cards digitally, by mail, or donate it to a charity of your choice
