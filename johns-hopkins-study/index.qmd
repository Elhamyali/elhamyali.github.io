## **Key points**

-   Join a **national Johns Hopkins study** anytime from **January 5 ‚Äì April 30, 2026** to share your professional insights and experiences on how your local government plans and delivers **equitable parks and green spaces**. You can take part by completing an online survey and/or joining a virtual interview.

-   This study is open to anyone **18 or older** who works with U.S. local governments (city, county, or township) on parks, green spaces, climate, sustainability, or related community issues.

-   When you participate, you‚Äôll receive a **gift card ($$$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both (you can also choose to donate it). You‚Äôll also get a summary of national findings you can use in your work, an optional customized report showing your organization‚Äôs readiness to advance equitable, upstream green space initiatives, and authorship credit in published results if you‚Äôd like.

## What is this study about?

Across the United States, cities, counties, and townships are investing in parks and green spaces as essential infrastructure to improve community health, equity, and climate resilience. But what helps local governments make that happen and what gets in the way?

This study looks at both sides of the equation:

-   **Internal readiness**: how prepared local governments are to deliver equitable parks and green space policies and practices\

-   **External pressures**: the outside factors that influence that work, from funding to political priorities

In addition to hearing from government practitioners, we‚Äôre also reviewing park and green space policies from cities across the country to learn how equity shows up in practice. 

This research is part of a doctoral dissertation at the **Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health**, led by student researcher **Elham Ali, MPH, PMP**, under the supervision of faculty advisor **Jill Marsteller, PhD, MPP** (IRB00034299).

The [Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional-review-board){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has reviewed this study and determined it is **‚Äúnot human subjects research.‚Äù** That means we‚Äôre asking about your professional insights and experiences of your organization, not private or personal information. Your responses will stay confidential.

## When is this study happening?

The study will run from **January 5 through April 30, 2026.**

You can join at any time during this period and participate once or in both parts (survey and interview) depending on your availability.

## Who can participate?

We‚Äôre looking for people who:

-   Work in **a U.S. city, county, or township government**

-   Are **18 or older**

-   Work on **parks, green spaces, climate, sustainability, or related community issues**

We encourage **three or more people from each organization** to join so we can hear different perspectives but we also know that many environmental, climate, and sustainability offices are small. Even if you‚Äôre a *team of one*, your voice matters.

## Why should I join?

Your insights of your organization can help shape how local governments across the U.S. deliver parks and green spaces that are fair, effective, and community-centered.

When you participate, you‚Äôll:

-   Share what **your local government needs** to make parks and green space equity possible

-   Receive a **summary of the national findings** you can use in your work

-   Get a **customized snapshot** of your organization‚Äôs readiness to advance equitable, upstream green space initiatives

-   Receive **authorship credit** if you‚Äôd like

-   Get a **gift card ($$$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both. We can send gift cards digitally, by mail, or donate it to a charity of your choice
