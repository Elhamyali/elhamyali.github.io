## Key points

-   Join a **national Johns Hopkins study** anytime by **March 31, 2026** to share your professional insights on how your local government plans and delivers **equitable parks and green spaces**. You can take part by completing an online survey and/or joining a virtual interview.

-   This study is open to anyone 18 or older who works with **U.S. local governments (city, county, or township)** on parks, green spaces, climate, sustainability, or related topics.

-   When you participate, you’ll receive a **gift card (\$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both (you can also choose to donate it). You’ll also get a summary of national findings you can use in your work and authorship credit in published results if you’d like.

## What is this study about?

Cities, counties, and townships across the United States are investing in **parks and green spaces** to improve health, advance equity, and strengthen climate resilience. But what helps local governments make that happen—and what gets in the way?

This study looks upstream, beyond how parks are built, to the policies, land use decisions, and organizational practices that shape equity.

**Local governments are central to this work.** With control over zoning, funding, and infrastructure, they shape how communities adapt to climate risks and who benefits from those decisions.

We’re exploring both sides of the story:\

• **Internal readiness** — how prepared local governments are to act on parks and green space equity\

• **External pressures** — outside forces like funding, mandates, and politics that influence action

We’re also analyzing park and green space policies nationwide to see how equity shows up in practice and where gaps remain. By sharing your experience, you’ll help identify the conditions, partnerships, and resources that make equitable green space possible.

This research is part of a **doctoral dissertation** at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, led by student researcher Elham Ali, MPH, PMP, under the supervision of Jill Marsteller, PhD, MPP (IRB00034299).

The [Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional-review-board){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has reviewed this study and determined it is **“not human subjects research”** under DHHS regulations 45 CFR 46.102. That means we’re asking about your professional perspectives of your organization, not private or personal information. Your responses will stay confidential.

## When is this study happening?

You can join the study at any time by **March 31, 2026** and participate once or in both parts (survey and interview) depending on your interest.

## Who can participate?

We’re looking for people who:

-   Are **18 or older**

-   Work in **a U.S. city, county, township, or consolidated government,** regardless of whether you serve urban, suburban, rural, or unincorporated communities

-   Work on **parks, green spaces, climate, environment, sustainability, or related topics**

We’d love to hear from **three or more people from each organization** so we can learn from different roles and perspectives. That said, many environmental and sustainability offices doing this work are small. If you’re a **team of one**, your experience is still incredibly valuable. We want to hear from you too.

## Why should I join?

When you participate, you’ll:

-   Share what **your local government needs** to make parks and green space equity possible

-   Receive a **summary of the national findings** you can use in your work to benchmark readiness and progress

-   Receive **authorship credit** if you’d like

-   Get a **gift card (\$)** for completing the online survey, the virtual interview, or both. We can send gift cards digitally, by mail, or donate it to a charity of your choice
