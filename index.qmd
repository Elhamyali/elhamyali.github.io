I'm a mixed-methods design researcher with a decade of experience in human-centered design, impact evaluation, and data analysis with storytelling in civic tech and public health.

I help cities equitably implement and evaluate the impact <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-are-nature-based-solutions-and-how-can-they-help-us-address-the-climate-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nature-based climate solutions</a> to be confident in making informed decisions that protect our planet. 🌍 I also support cities in building a climate-ready workforce, preparing today's and future generations to create a sustainable, resilient climate. 🌱🌿

🔍 I specialize in uncovering user behavior insights through evidence-based research and developing equity-focused, actionable data products---from maps to data stories. My goal is to help people discover deeper truths about the world and human experience, and to reveal stories that shift norms and shape conversations. Here is some of my featured work.
