I'm a mixed-methods design researcher with a decade of experience in human-centered design, impact evaluation, and data analysis with storytelling in civic tech and public health.

I'm a scholar with the [Crown Prince International Scholarship Program](https://www.cpisp.bh/) in Bahrain üáßüá≠, and a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University in Health Equity and Social Justice. My research helps cities equitably implement and evaluate [nature-based climate solutions](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/natural-climate-solutions/) so they can make informed decisions that improve our climate. üåø

üîç I specialize in uncovering user behavior insights through evidence-based research and developing equity-focused, actionable data products---from maps to data stories. My goal is to help people discover deeper truths about the world and human experience, and to reveal stories that shift norms and shape conversations. Here is some of my featured work.
