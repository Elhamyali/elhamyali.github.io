I'm a researcher and writer working at the intersection of climate resilience and justice, health equity, and local climate governance. üå±üåø

I help cities and counties equitably implement and evaluate <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-are-nature-based-solutions-and-how-can-they-help-us-address-the-climate-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nature-based climate solutions</a> so they can make informed and confident decisions that protect our planet.

In Akron, OH, I helped evaluate tree canopy mapping to inform climate and health equity decisions. In Saint Paul, MN, I supported efforts to build a climate-ready workforce---centering communities of color---so current and future generations are equipped to create a more just, sustainable world. üåç

üîç As a mixed-methods design researcher, I bring over a decade of experience in human-centered design, impact evaluation, and data storytelling across civic tech and public health. I specialize in uncovering user behavior insights and creating equity-focused, actionable data products---from interactive maps to visual data stories---that reveals deeper truths about the world and human experience. My work helps shift norms and shape conversations.

Here is a sample of my work.
