üìä I‚Äôm a researcher and writer who translates community voices and local insights into equity-focused data products---from interactive maps to visual stories---that reveal deeper truths about our world, shift norms, and drive action.

With a decade of experience in research and evaluation, data analysis, and human-centered design, I focus on <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-are-nature-based-solutions-and-how-can-they-help-us-address-the-climate-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nature-based climate solutions</a>, specifically parks and green space equity. I work with local governments to ensure climate action centers health equity, social justice, and community needs. From tree canopy mapping in Akron to increasing access to quality green jobs in Saint Paul, I help cities make informed, confident decisions that protect both people and planet. üåçüåø

Here's a sample of my work.

    Climate resilience requires equitable access to quality green jobs. Saint Paul is making strides.
