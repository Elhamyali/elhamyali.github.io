üìä I'm a researcher and writer who translates community voices and local insights into data experiences from interactive maps to visual stories that reveal deeper truths about our world, shift norms, and drive action.

With a decade of experience in research and evaluation, data analysis, and human-centered design in civic tech and public health, I focus on <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-are-nature-based-solutions-and-how-can-they-help-us-address-the-climate-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nature-based climate solutions</a>, specifically parks and green spaces. I work with local governments to ensure climate action centers health equity, social justice, and community needs. From mapping tree canopy in Akron to increasing access to quality green jobs in Saint Paul, I help cities make informed, confident decisions that protect both people and our planet. üåçüåø

Here's a sample of my work.

Using user research from the City of Saint Paul and national datasets, I analyzed racial and income inequities in access to quality green jobs across three sectors. The findings were featured on the Beeck Center's <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/saint-paul-climate-resilience-equity-green-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, <a href="https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/report/2024-impact-report/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annual impact report</a> and <a href="https://fullstacksaintpaul.com/climate-resilience-requires-equitable-access-to-quality-green-jobs-saint-paul-is-making-strides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Stack Saint Paul</a>.
