Behind every ingredient, bite, and meal we eat is a farmer's story. 500M smallholder farms are supporting 2B people globally. Yet, the majority of the world\'s hungry are farmers. U.S. agriculture today appears to be as segregated as it was a century ago, with farmers of color at a significant disadvantage. Today, they cultivate less than half of one percent of the country\'s farmland. [[Dr. Larissa Estes-White, DrPH]{.underline}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larissaesteswhite-drph) shares her family legacy in farming across the U.S. and Philippines. She tells stories of racist land ownership, food sovereignty, and hopes to build a just circular food economy. Dr. Estes-White is the Executive Director of ALL IN Alameda County.

### Memorable moments

{{< video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tOkm4qKkiQ" >}}

> "My great grandmother, who was a cook at St. Joseph's Hospital in Houston, she owned a home within walking distance of the hospital, which was destroyed eventually when a freeway was put in. And she died from a heart attack in 1953, in route to Houston Negro hospital because her own employer wouldn't accept her as a patient. And, you know, for me, that's connection to food and that she was a food service worker, the impact of government and eminent domain, racism within the healthcare system. But then full circle, my grandfather was actually a patient and saw many physicians there in that same hospital system. And, you know, I never he was he wasn't a big talker. But I'm curious as to what his own perspective was of his own mother's death, as it relates to being a provider and, you know, in a worker and having to go to receive services at that same place, and I like what that does, and what that really means."
