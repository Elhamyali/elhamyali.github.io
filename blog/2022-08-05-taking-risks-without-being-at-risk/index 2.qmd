### Memorable moments

> "Sharing power is what a lot of opportunity and leadership is about. And it's definitely what needs to happen. So on a, let's say, at a micro level in a instruction session on one of my courses or in a coaching, scenario, group coaching, like the one I was just talking about, one way to share power is to make sure everyone's heard, right, that's what you were part of what you were alluding to. And one way to make sure everybody's heard, it just has a facilitator, this is real simple, is have everybody sit and write, sit and think and write for five minutes before instead of just going with whoever stands up or raises their hand or you know, is really good at interrupting or, you know, getting into the flow of conversation, because they're used to people listening to them, and they're, they're more extroverted probably. So just having that pause to say, Come up with your ideas, and then we're going to share them and you can share them in writing with the person next to you. There's lots of ways to build that out until it's shared in the whole group. So that's one way to help people who is to set that expectation and set and set again, it's we're not just gonna start talking. We're gonna have everybody write something down so that everyone has something to contribute, if they choose to."
