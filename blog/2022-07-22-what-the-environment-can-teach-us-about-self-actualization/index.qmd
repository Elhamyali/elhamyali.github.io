We all want to realize our true potential and unlock our best selves. This is self-actualization. But what helps organizations achieve self-actualization to deliver equitable and just services and products to communities most historically marginalized? [[Ronnell Hampton]{.underline}](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnell-hampton8830) says we like to think it\'s only nurture - but in his personal experiences and work, he has found it\'s also more often nature and the built environment. Ronnell Hampton is the Principal Equity Strategy at a large government municipality and the Founder of Growing Greatness.

### Memorable moments

{{< video "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bmj92O_mikU" >}}

> "This idea of self-actualization comes through engagement you have to engage with people to self-actualize. When you are alone, you only have yourself to bounce your ideas off to be your control for your testing and your theories and your thinking. But when you engage with folks, you get to see not only if you're testing your thinking works, but how others people testing and thinking works. And when we're isolated in community, or an individual space, our ability to comprehend other people's positions, or even be willing to analyze or consider other people's position."
